# Base — Tax Change Sniper

Most rug detectors wait for LP removal.

This one screams the second a dev **changes buy/sell tax** — even by 1%.

Because real rugs don't always burn LP.  
Sometimes they just quietly crank sell tax from 5% → 99% while you're still aping.

## Run

```bash
python base_tax_change_sniper.py
